## This is the code scripts for simulating a Hankin and Mitchell's Daisyworld with Lotka-Volterra predators.
### Their article "Resolving the anomaly of bare habitable ground in Daisyworld" can be found here: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0889.2010.00511.x?needAccess=true

The steps are as follows:

1. Open 'Functions' in R.
2. Source the script into global environment.
3. Open 'Outputs' in R.
4. Run chunck by chunck while changing desired parameters for investigation.

Enjoy!
